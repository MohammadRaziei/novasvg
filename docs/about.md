# About NovaSVG

NovaSVG is a single-header, header-only C++17 SVG parsing and rasterization library with optional Python bindings.

## Semantics, Origin, and Rebirth

NovaSVG was born from a practical need.

There was an earlier project called *lunasvg*.  
The name came from *luna* — the moon — a quiet celestial body associated with reflection and continuity.

However, from an architectural perspective, it had limitations for my workflow:

- It was not header-only, which made it unsuitable for strict header-only projects.
- It relied on a submodule, and I prefer keeping dependency layers flat and minimal.
- It did not provide a true single-header distribution suitable for frictionless integration or Python binding workflows.

Rather than adapting around those constraints, I chose to restructure the idea entirely.

NovaSVG emerged through substantial refactoring and surgical redesign.  
It was not a wrapper, not a patch, and not a thin modification — it was a reconstruction with different structural goals.

In astronomy, a *nova* is not the creation of a star from nothing.  
It is the visible rebirth of a stellar system — energy released from within, forming something newly luminous.

That metaphor captures the transition precisely:

Luna retires.  
A new star emerges.

NovaSVG carries conceptual lineage, but stands independently in structure and intent.

The name also sits close to *nanosvg* in sound.  
That resemblance is natural within the ecosystem of lightweight SVG tooling.  
Yet while nanosvg attempts a compact approach, NovaSVG is built around a stricter single-header philosophy and tighter architectural boundaries.

The similarity in name reflects adjacency;  
the difference in structure reflects direction.

NovaSVG is therefore both continuation and departure —  
a transformation shaped by constraints, not an extension shaped by convenience.
